# ros_project_2020

## Launching the project

Our project has an entry script file which a user can give commands to achieve the tasks and a customized launch file that sets up the required nodes and configuration parameters in place for the script to work properly. Since some functionality of the application required us to select points from the map we also use Rviz.

**First we launch the base**

Using a terminal;

`roslaunch ros_project_2020 move_base.launch`

**Second we launch the application**

From another terminal

`rosrun ros_project_2020 main.py`

**Launching the Rviz for observing**

In order to observe the robot 

`rosrun rviz rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_project_2020/turtlebot3_slam.rviz`
