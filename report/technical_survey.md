# Introduction


For our robotics project we are expected to use ROS _a suite of linked software designed to interface and simplify robotics hardware_ on a robot platform called Turtlebot 3 to accomplish the following tasks; **to move the robot using simple velocity commands, map an environment, setup coordinate based move command and finally using the setup move the robot to through given waypoints while avoiding obstacles**

# Techniques

Ros framework contains many libraries and packages to simplify common tasks
